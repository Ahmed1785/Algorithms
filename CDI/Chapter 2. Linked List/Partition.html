You want to create two separate linked list. One to hold all values less then x, and the other to hold all values greater than x
You want to create a pointer for each linked list as well as a pointer for head. So in total, you'll have 5 pointers

<script>
    function Partition(self, head, x){
        var less = new Node(val);
        var more = new Node(val);
        var curr1 = less;
        var curr2 = more;
        var cur = head;
        while(cur){
            if(head.val < x){
                curr1.next = cur;
                curr1 = curr1.next
            }else{
                curr2.next = cur; 
                curr2 = curr2.next;
            }
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        curr2.next = null;
        curr1.next = more.next;
        return dummy1.next
    }
</script>
